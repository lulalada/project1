project java
It is my small project as a movie site app.
It has OOP and SOLID principles. It uses PostgreSQl to store information in database.
1) Run Server.java
2) Run Main.java
We have 4 types of users: unsigned users, signed users, and users with subscription
and admins.
1) Unsigned user can see the list of movies. They can use filter to find movie by 
parameters. The can use search to find movie by name.
2) Singed user can do all above and watch movies, which will make a list of watched 
movies for the user. They can rate watched movies. They also can buy subscription 
and become vip user.
3) VIP users can do everything above and they have recommendation page. They also can
cancel subscription.
4) Admins can add, delete and update movies and delete users.
